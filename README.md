to indicate the destination based on a geographic coordinate system.

## Technologies
Project is created with:

* Depedency injection with Hilt
* MVI architecture with ViewModel
* Coroutines android
* UI/UX 
* Test Esspresso, JUnit
## Approach
I've used dependency injection with Hilt because is very similar to Dagger 2 and is more simple to use .  I used the available tools from Android Sdk to download the current position of the user (LocationManager) and to indicate geographical directions(SensorManager)
